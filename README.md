# Face_recognition_based_attendance_system
A python GUI integrated attendance system using face recognition to take attendance.

In this python project, I have made an attendance system which takes attendance by using face recognition technique. I have also intergrated it with GUI (Graphical user interface) so it can be easy to use by anyone. GUI for this project is also made on python using tkinter.

# TECHNOLOGY USED:
> tkinter for whole GUI
> OpenCV for taking images and face recognition (cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create())
> CSV, Numpy, Pandas, datetime etc. for other purposes.

# FEATURES:
> Easy to use with interactive GUI support.
> Password protection for new person registration.
> Creates/Updates CSV file for deatils of students on registration.
> Creates a new CSV file everyday for attendance and marks attendance with proper date and time.
> Displays live attendance updates for the day on the main screen in tabular format with Id, name, date and time.
